        "For our dataset, we chose to perform market basket analysis on a \"student performance\" dataset. Within the dataset, a wide variety of information of students was collected with the goal of predicting how well a student performs in certain classes. The intended label(s) was the the grade that students received in their first and second semesters, as well as their final, combined grade. The data was collected on students completing secondary education in two different Portuguese schools, where class subjects were math and Portuguese. The data collected for each class was collected in separate datasets; we decided to only perform analysis on the math dataset, where the performance of students varied more. There were a total of 30 attributes, which included information such as the occupation of the student's parents, the relationship of the students with their parents, whether or not the student drinks (alchohol) during the weekend/weekdays, whether the student is in a romantic relationship, etc. The attributes used to determine a student's performance in a math class were quite diverse and had the potential to create interesting association rules with each other.\n",

        "After dropping those features, we ran into the first hurdle in our project: what do we do with the numerical features in our dataset? We needed a way to represent not just the presence of a feature but also its \"intensity\". If we buy 64 apples, we can't just say label that as \"having bought apples\", the number tells us a lot about the consumer. At the same time however, we can't pass these numerical features as they are because they will be deemed worthless to the market basket analysis. If \"64 apples\" is now an item, there's a really low chance of that item appearing in another person's shopping cart. So we do need to group these numerical features and the way we do this is going to be different for each feature.\n",

        "Apparently, in Portugal, students are graded on a scale of 1-20 which is pretty interesting. As a result, the G1, G2, and G3 features go from 1-20 as well. For G1, since it's the first term, the students probably wouldn't have had many tests so their grades would likely be all over the place. Additionally, since it's the beginning of the semester, we wanted to use a more lenient grading distribution since the grades they get then aren't very indicative of their understanding of the material. \n",
        "\n",
        "For G2 and G3, since by then we have a better understanding of the student's proficiency in the subject, we made the grading distribution harsher. To choose the grades, we converted the 1-20 system to an A-F system which might not have been the best option. It's possible that in Portugal, a grade of 15 doesn't actually translate to a 75%. However, without any reference on the grading system, we decided to stick with our conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then for age, we split it between students below 18 and those above 18. So the reason why we did this was because as far as we knew, there weren't any significant differences between people within these age groups. However, there is a significant difference between students above and below 18. For one, at 18, in Portugal, it's legal for students to drink alcohol which is also a feature in our dataset. We didn't look into this but if Portugal is like the US, then students who are 18 or older can work for longer hours which can definitely impact school performance. \n",

        "Rarely Absent, Often Absent, and Frequently Absent. We didn't want to split the feature further because we felt that the feature would lose any meaninful intepretation even if it does end up in a lot of rules."

So for example, you either do study a lot or don't study, have a lot of free time or don't, etc. Since these are survey questions, it would be hard to make any further inferences using the intensities of the features since how people rate stuff pertaining to themselves varies wildly from person to person.

Interestingly, students that didn't seek out school support were associated with having failed none or few classes and pursuing higher education. One possible explanation for this might be that students who don't seek out school support might be good at self studying/doing research to answer their questions. Unfortunately, none of the rules include the grades that the students got for the math class which is pretty disappointing.

This is to be expected because if the confidence and support are high for a student that wishes to pursue higher education fails few/no classes and has a low commute time, we could also expect high confidence and support for a student that has a low commute time to fail few/no classes and to want to pursue higher education. However, in addition to this, it seems as though the same 6-7 attributes appear in every rule. The 23-24 other attributes do not make an appearance at all. Furthermore, what these rules are telling us goes along the lines of: avoiding drinking on weekdays, having good family relationships, and wanting to pursue higher education leads to students failing few or no classes in the past. This is not something we didn't already know, and isn't quite as interesting as we hoped it to be. We suspect this is because almost all of the students possessed these 6-7 attributes, but not necessarily the others, giving them high support values.\n",
